# Portfolio Mari Caginicolau

## introduction
Hi! I’m a second-year Master’s student in Computer Science, specializing in video game development. I’m currently looking for an internship to complete my degree and grow my skills.

Over the years, I’ve worked on a wide variety of projects—from AI systems in an MMORPG and a multiplayer Bomberman game, to building procedural villages in a 2D Minecraft-like world. Whether I’m coding, modeling in Blender, or designing game mechanics, I love exploring every corner of game development.

I’m most at home with code and 3D modeling, but I enjoy jumping into anything creative. I’ve worked with Unity, Unreal Engine 5, Java, C++, Python, and Blender (entirely self-taught!), and I’ve also dabbled in tools like Illustrator, Krita, and various modeling software. I’ve even made my own assets from scratch for a UE5 simple ambulance sim where AI-driven ambulances assist the player in real-time.

Whether it’s gameplay programming, asset creation, or systems design, I’m always up for a challenge and excited to learn more.
